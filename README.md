The LoRa®Mote is battery powered, providing a portable tool to demonstrate the excellent long-range capabilities of the RN2903. The interoperability with LoRaWANv1.0 compliant gateways and infrastructure can also be verified.

Also demonstrated is Wireless Sensor Network communication. Telemetry provided by an on-board Ambient Light Sensor and Thermistor can be transmitted as per a user-defined schedule, or initiated on demand via button-press on the Mote. An OLED display provides feedback on connection status, sensor values, downlink data and acknowledgements.

A standard USB interface is provided for connecting the Mote to a host computer. When connected, the on-board USB-to-UART bridge allows simple setup and control of the LoRaWAN™ protocol stack using the high-level ASCII command set.
